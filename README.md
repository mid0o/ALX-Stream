# ALX-Stream: A Frontend-Only Streaming Platform

ALX-Stream is a modern, responsive frontend application for a movie streaming platform, built for the ALX Webstack Portfolio Project. This project demonstrates a complete, complex user interface built with **React 18** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

To achieve a dynamic user experience within the project's scope, this application utilizes a **mocked data module (`src/Data/MovieData.js`)** to simulate API responses, as permitted for frontend-only projects.
